//      high = in   - low - q*band
//      band = band + f*high
//      y    = low
//  f = 2*sin(pi*f0/fs) and q = 1/Q, both Q16 inputs, because the LPF bit moves
//  the YM filter between 8941 Hz / Q 0.742 and 4312 Hz / Q 0.358 at run time.
//  An SVF is used because f0/fs is only 0.0012-0.005, where a direct-form
//  biquad needs far more coefficient precision.  State is Q16 with 18 integer
//  bits so the small resonant overshoot cannot wrap.  The multiplies are
//  registered between ce pulses, as in offtwall_snd_iir1.
